# Welcome to My Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

I’m Anushka Karki, a senior Computer Science student at Northern Kentucky University, graduating in May 2026. I am currently a Data & Advanced Analytics Intern at the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE), where I work on data preparation, analysis, and research-related projects that support statewide higher-education initiatives.

Throughout my academic career, I have completed a variety of technical, research, and course-based projects that strengthened my skills in programming, analysis, and problem-solving. I enjoy approaching problems with structure and clarity, and I’m continually working to expand my technical abilities as I prepare for future opportunities in the field.

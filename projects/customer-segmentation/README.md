# Customer Segmentation & Sales Analysis 

This is an individual project where I explored customer purchasing behavior and identified meaningful customer segments using data analysis and clustering techniques. The project demonstrates my understanding of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and unsupervised learning.

## 🔹 What I Did

- Cleaned and prepared the entire dataset (handled missing values, standardized column formats, removed noise)
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand product trends, customer spending patterns, and category-level behaviors
- Engineered new features such as:
  - total spending
  - number of transactions
  - average order value
  - preferred product category
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group customers into segments
- Evaluated cluster quality and interpreted each segment’s characteristics
- Created summaries and visualizations to explain insights and results

## 🔹 Project Overview

- Dataset: customer shopping data with multiple attributes (products, categories, prices, dates, etc.)
- EDA tasks included:
  - customer-level spending patterns  
  - category popularity  
  - distribution of purchases  
- Feature engineering for clustering
- Used K-Means to identify groups such as:
  - high-value frequent shoppers  
  - low-spend occasional buyers  
  - category-specific shoppers  
- Summarized insights for potential marketing use-cases

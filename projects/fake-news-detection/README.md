# Fake News Detection 

This is a project where I built a text-classification model to identify misleading or false news articles. The project demonstrates my ability to preprocess text data, extract meaningful features, and apply machine learning techniques for classification.

## 🔹 What I Did

- Cleaned and prepared the entire dataset  
  (removed punctuation, stopwords, lowercased text, etc.)
- Converted text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**
- Built and trained the **Logistic Regression** classification model
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - accuracy  
  - precision  
  - recall  
  - confusion matrix
- Analyzed misclassified articles to understand model errors
- Created summary insights on what improved or limited model performance

## 🔹 Project Overview

- Worked with a labeled dataset of real vs. fake news articles  
- Applied end-to-end NLP preprocessing  
- Used **TF-IDF** to convert text into machine-readable features  
- Trained and tested a Logistic Regression model for classification  
- Evaluated performance using standard machine learning metrics  
- Documented strengths and weaknesses of the classifier

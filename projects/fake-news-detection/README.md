# Fake News Detection (Text Classification Project)

This project focuses on identifying misleading or false news articles using text-based features and machine learning techniques. It was completed as part of my academic coursework and demonstrates my ability to work with text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification models.

## 🔹 My Role in the Project

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset (removing punctuation, stopwords, lowercasing, etc.)
- Converted text into features using **TF-IDF vectorization**
- Built and evaluated a classification model (Logistic Regression)
- Analyzed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Helped interpret misclassifications and model behavior

## 🔹 Project Overview

- Used a labeled dataset of real vs. fake news articles  
- Preprocessed the text using NLP techniques  
- Converted articles into numerical features using **TF-IDF**  
- Trained and tested a **Logistic Regression classifier**  
- Evaluated performance using standard ML metrics  
- Explored improvements and limitations of the model
